                    <p class="explain">This was the first website I had ever built and was my first submission to Code Institute's full stack web-development course. 
                        It is a travel website aimed at holidaymakers who wish to visit and travel around the Caribbean. There are some small bugs with this website, 
                        however overall I am really proud of what I achieved with this project considering I had no prior experience of coding or web development.
                        The website is built with HTML and CSS only.<br><br>

                        This was my first taste of Object Orientated Programming, and I really enjoyed using a more in-depth programming language, it made me realise 
                        that the possibilities with programming really are endless. <br><br>

                        with small elements of personal CSS styling. I had so much fun creating this project as it really allowed me to express my creative and storytelling side.

                        implemented in real-life, it was really enjoyable to create a project that would be beneficial to the department I currently work in, and to 
                        create a website that would be beneficial and educational for the patients of the East Lancashire area. This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, 
                        JavaScript, Python, Django, PostgreSQL for database storage and Heroku for deployment.
